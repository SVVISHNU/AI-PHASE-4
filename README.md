## Introduction

The GitHub Association Analysis project leverages data mining techniques to discover interesting relationships and patterns within GitHub repositories. It utilizes association rule learning to identify significant associations between various attributes, such as programming languages, repository topics, and user demographics. The results of this analysis can provide valuable insights for developers, project managers, and researchers interested in understanding the dynamics of the GitHub platform.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- mlxtend

Ensure that all necessary packages are installed before running the Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-association-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the `GitHub_Association_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run the association analysis on the GitHub data.

4. Adjust the parameters and configurations according to your analysis requirements.

## Results

The results of the association analysis will be presented in the Jupyter Notebook, along with visualizations and insights derived from the data. These findings can be used to understand the relationships between different GitHub attributes and guide decision-making processes related to repository management, language adoption, and community engagement.

## Contributing
